# House Price Prediction 

The code is designed to provide insights into how various factors, such as housing inventory, mortgage rates, consumer sentiment, interest rates, median sales price, and GDP, have influenced home prices over the last two decades. It does this by both visualizing the trends in these factors and evaluating machine learning models to understand their predictive power. The R-squared scores and cross-validation results can help assess the impact and predictive ability of these factors on home prices.
